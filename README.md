💡 Financial Inclusion — Datathon Notes
🌍 Overview

Financial inclusion aims to give everyone fair access to formal financial services — like savings, credit, and insurance — regardless of their background or income level.
Yet, billions remain outside this system, unable to borrow or save through trusted institutions such as banks.

1️⃣ Global Access to Finance

Around 1.3 billion people lack access to formal financial systems.

They are not allowed to save or borrow from any trusted source such as banks.

2️⃣ Concentration of Financial Exclusion

650 million of these individuals are concentrated in just 8 countries:

Bangladesh

China

Egypt

India

Indonesia

Mexico

Nigeria

Pakistan

3️⃣ India’s Case

Nearly 160 million Indians are “Credit Invisible.”

They pay bills on time, but traditional systems exclude them because they lack a CIBIL score.

4️⃣ Understanding Credit Scores

A CIBIL score is a 3-digit number (300–900) that indicates how trustworthy a person is with credit and money.

Without this score, even financially responsible individuals often struggle to access loans or credit cards.

5️⃣ Traditional Banking Limitations

Traditional banks rely mainly on credit history,
which does not exist for:

Farmers

Students

Freelancers

Gig workers

🚀 Why It Matters

The “credit invisible” population represents massive untapped potential.
By combining AI, alternative data, and behavioral insights, we can build models that measure creditworthiness beyond traditional CIBIL scores — bringing millions into the formal economy.
